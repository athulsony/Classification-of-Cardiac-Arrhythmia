# Classification-of-Cardiac-Arrhythmia

This project aims at classifying the Cardiac Arrhythmia disease into two classes â€“ Normal ECG and Heart Disease. Dataset was obtained from University of California at Irvine Machine Learning Data Repository. Each record contains clinical measurements from ECG signals and intervals and some other information such as sex, age, weight, along with the decision of a cardiologist. The dataset has 452 records of patients and 279 attributes which mostly has numerical columns. Performed PCA on 198 numerical columns and selected 41 principal components for further analysis. Applied several models on this dataset including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Boosted Trees, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. Out of the models built using these algorithms, Boosted Trees gave the maximum accuracy
